Today I need to meet you in any way
Even if it's just to bring you home
After a normal day
Look at your eyes of easy promises
Kiss your mouth in a way that will make you laugh
Today I need to hug you
Feel your smell of clean clothes
To forget all my yearnings and sleep in peace
Today I need to hear any word from you
Any exaggerated phrase that will make me feel joy
In being alive
Today I need to drink a cup of coffee, listening to
you breathing
Telling me that I'm the cause of your insomnia
That I always do everything wrong
Today I need you
With any mood, with any smile
Today only your presence
Will make me happy
Only today
