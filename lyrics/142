Baby, why you getting' down?
Life is sweet, just look around
Time has give you every treasure
Good life lived beyond all measure
You can't say nothin's wrong
If they don't like your song
You just got to be strong
Shame on you!
Baby didn't get her way
Troubles only last one day
Can´t see why you´re getting´ down
Why do you want to get down
If you're so especial?
Don't worry, don't you worry
Why do you want to get down?
Feeling strong and walking tall
Remember that you've got it all
Pack it up and start to move on
Bag your joy and bring it along
If you thik something's wrong
Then just pick up the phone
That's what friends are for
Shame on you!
Set your sights on all that´s good
Living like hollywood
Can't see why you getting down
Why do you want to get down
If you're so especial?
Don't worry, don't you worry
Why do you want to get down
