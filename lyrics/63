Oh thinkin' about all our younger years,
There was only you and me
We were young and wild and free
Now nothin' can take you away from me
We've been done that road before
But that's over now
You keep me comin' back for more
Baby you're all the i want
When you're lying here in my arms
I'm finding it hard to believe
We're in heaven
And love is all that i need
And i found it there in your heart
It isn't too hard to see
We're in heaven
Oh- once in your life you'll find someone
Who will turn you're world around
Bring you up when you're feeling down
Ya nothin' could change what you mean to me
Oh there's lots that i could say
But just hold me now
Cause your love will light the way
N' baby you're all that i want
When you're lyin' here in my arms
I'm findin' it hard to believe
We're in heaven
And love is all that i need
And i found it there in your heart
It isn't too hard to see
We're in heaven
I've been waitin' for so long
For something to arrive
For love to come along
Now our dreams are comin' true
Through the good times and the bad
I'll be standing there by you.
